## Downloads
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/massgmad/releases) for the current version and a nice changelog.

## Differences from the older version
1. written in Java
2. supports folders with spaces
3. multiplatform? (untested on macOS and Linux)
4. more stable

## Building
I used IntelliJ IDEA 2016.3.2 to create massgmad, so I recommend downloading (or using git) the repo and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.

If you do not have IntelliJ IDEA or too lazy to install it, you could try to grab the `.java` files and use them in your favorite Java IDE.
